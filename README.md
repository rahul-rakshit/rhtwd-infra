# About

This is the infrastructure repository for my raspberry pi cluster.

RHTWD stands for ``Rahul`s Himbeertorten-Wolkendienstleistungen``, which is a humorous literal translation of "Rahul's raspberry pie cloud services". Please note the horrible backtick, which German speakers use instead of the possessive apostophe (even though the German language doesn't use possessive apostrophes).
